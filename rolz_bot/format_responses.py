This bot proxies your rolls to rolz.org.
Syntax info can be found here:
https://rolz.org/wiki/page?w=help&n=BasicCodes
```
To roll you use !roll. Example:
!roll 6d6
It can use multiple rolls with !sum and !repeat. Example:
!sum 5 1d6
!repeat 5 1d6
It can also use choose. Example:
!choose Love, Marry, Kill

I have added full support for the nwod dice. Specific format for
success based dice for cofd and nwod. Here is how you use it:
!nwod 10 -- this roll 10 nwod dice.
!nwod r10 -- this rolls 10 nwod rote dice.
!nwod 10e8 -- this rolls 10 nwod dice with every 8 exploding.

Those can be combined, for example:
!nwod r10e8 -- will roll 10 nwod rote dice that explode on 8.

There is a tarot feature, that will give you a randomized tarot card:
!tarot

There is a value feature, that will store user specified value.
Limited by 1000 symbols.
To create a value use !value create. Example:
!value create "Spaceship" "Its a space walrus!"
To show a value use !value show. Example:
!value show "Spaceship" -- this will print you the value of Spaceship as defined earlier.
To show a list of defined values use !value list. Example:
!value list -- this will print you a list of your values.
To delete a defined value use !value delete "NAME". Example:
!value delete "Spaceship"
```
